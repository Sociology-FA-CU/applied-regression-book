# Packages {.unnumbered}

It this book, we will use several packages to help us work with and understand regression. You can install them all by using the following command:

```{r packages-install}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "broom",
                   "marginaleffects",
                   "lspline",
                   "performance",
                   "bayestestR"))
```

From `{tidyverse}`, we will mainly borrow function data preprocessing and visualization. `{broom}` will help us extract information about our models in tidy format. `{marginaleffects}` will be instrumental for interpreting more complex models. When it comes to modeling nonlinear relationships, the `{lspline}` package will prove very useful. The `{performance}` package includes some useful functions for assumptions checking for beginners. Lastly, we will use `bayestestR` for an uncommon, but useful, take on hypothesis testing.
